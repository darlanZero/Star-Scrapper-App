# star_scrapper_app

A Mangas/Comics scrapper app that fetches the latest chapters of a manga/comic from a website and makes it available for users to read for free. The app is build with dart and flutter, and it's actually focused on mobile android devices and desktop windows machines.

This is a open source project, so feel free to contribute to it.

Heavily inspired by [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org/) and Mihon mobile application, but with a different approach.
